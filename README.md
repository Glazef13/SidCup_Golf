# SidCup_Golf is a clone of https://sidcupfamilygolf.com/ .
I liked their site very much and was intrigued by the site's user experiance and wanted to implement something myself. So, this is just a clone of their site for educational purpose.


Here's the clone version of site: https://glazef13.github.io/SidCup_Golf/

P.s : I don't know why I am not able to access the original site, because of which even my clone is not able to fetch the bg video from the site and some other resources. Though I have uploaded the images of the clone when it was working fine in the above attached pdf.
